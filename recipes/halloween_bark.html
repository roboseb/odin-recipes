    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bark and Halloween? What is this, a spooky dog tree?
        Today, it's chocolate I guess. And some of those
        awful chalky candies that come out of vending machines.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) bars dark chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package purple candy melts</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package green candy melts</li>
        <li>Assorted sprinkles and candies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Divide dark chocolate, purple candy melts, and green candy melts between 3 microwave-safe bowls. Heat each separately for 1 minute, then stir. Continue heating in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until completely melted.</li>
        <li>Pour contents of each bowl onto the pan in random spots; don't worry if they overlap. Shake pan to spread melted chocolate and candy. Use a knife to swirl colors together and shake pan again to spread even more. Sprinkle Halloween sprinkles and candy over chocolate mixture. Let set, about 15 minutes. Break into shards.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Does melting chocolate count as a recipe? On this site, you bet it does.</p>
